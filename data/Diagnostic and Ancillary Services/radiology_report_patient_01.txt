RADIOLOGY REPORT
Mercy Imaging Center

Patient Name: Mark Anthony Johnson
DOB: 07/15/1960 (Age: 64 years)
MRN: MR-2024-334455
Accession Number: ACC-789456123
Study Date: 10/03/2024
Study Time: 13:30 PM

Ordering Physician: Dr. Jennifer Smith, MD
Referring Physician: Dr. Michael Brown, MD

Clinical History:
64-year-old male with 3 weeks of intermittent chest pain. Recent cardiac stress test showed equivocal results. Evaluate for coronary artery disease.

Technique:
- Images acquired on Siemens Somatom Force CT scanner
- Cardiac gating utilized
- Contrast: Isovue 370 (100 mL)
- Slice thickness: 0.75 mm
- Reconstructions: Axial, coronal, sagittal, and curved multiplanar

Findings:

CORONARY ARTERIES:
- Left Main Coronary Artery: Normal caliber, no stenosis
- Left Anterior Descending Artery: Mild plaque in proximal segment (20-30% stenosis)
- Left Circumflex Artery: Patent, minimal plaque
- Right Coronary Artery: Moderate plaque in mid segment (40-50% stenosis)
- Posterior Descending Artery: Patent
- Overall coronary calcium score: 145 (moderate)

CARDIAC CHAMBERS AND VALVES:
- Left ventricle: Normal size and function
- Right ventricle: Normal
- Left atrium: Mildly enlarged (45 mm)
- Right atrium: Normal
- Mitral valve: Mild regurgitation, trace
- Aortic valve: Normal
- Tricuspid valve: Normal regurgitation, trace
- Pulmonary valve: Normal

GREAT VESSELS:
- Aorta: Normal caliber, no aneurysm or dissection
- Pulmonary arteries: Normal
- Superior vena cava: Patent
- Inferior vena cava: Patent

PERICARDIUM:
- No pericardial effusion

OTHER FINDINGS:
- Lungs: Clear, no nodules or infiltrates
- Mediastinum: Normal
- Lymph nodes: No enlarged lymph nodes
- Thyroid: Normal
- Esophagus: Normal
- Airways: Patent

Impression:
1. Moderate coronary artery atherosclerosis with 40-50% stenosis in the mid right coronary artery and mild plaque in the proximal left anterior descending artery.
2. No high-grade coronary stenosis identified.
3. Cardiac chambers normal size with preserved function.
4. No pericardial effusion or other significant findings.

Recommendations:
1. Medical management with antiplatelet therapy, statin, and beta-blocker as indicated.
2. Consider cardiology consultation for further evaluation and management.
3. Follow-up coronary CT angiogram in 12-18 months to monitor disease progression.
4. Lifestyle modifications: Smoking cessation (if applicable), weight management, regular exercise.
