Procedure: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiogram

Indications for Surgery:
The patient is a 45-year-old female who presented with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever. Ultrasound revealed multiple gallstones with gallbladder wall thickening and positive sonographic Murphy's sign. After failed conservative management with IV antibiotics, surgical intervention was indicated.

Procedure Details:
After induction of general anesthesia and placement of endotracheal tube, the patient was positioned supine. Pneumoperitoneum was established with Veress needle insertion in the umbilicus. Four laparoscopic ports were placed:

- 12mm port at umbilicus (camera)
- 5mm port in right upper quadrant
- 5mm port in right mid-abdomen
- 5mm port in epigastrium

The gallbladder was identified and dissected free from the liver bed using electrocautery. The cystic duct and artery were identified, clipped, and divided. Intraoperative cholangiogram was performed showing no filling defects or stones in the common bile duct.

The gallbladder was removed through the umbilical port. Hemostasis was achieved. The abdomen was irrigated with warm saline. Ports were closed with absorbable sutures in the fascia and skin.

Urine Output: 300 mL
