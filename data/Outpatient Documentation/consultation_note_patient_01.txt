ECG: Normal sinus rhythm, rate 68. No ST changes. Normal intervals.

Assessment:
1. Atypical angina pectoris - likely coronary artery disease
2. Hypertension - well controlled
3. Hyperlipidemia - well controlled
4. Type 2 diabetes mellitus - fair control
5. Chronic kidney disease stage 3

Recommendations:
1. Diagnostic cardiac stress testing (nuclear stress test) to evaluate for inducible ischemia
2. Continue current medical regimen
3. Lifestyle modifications: Cardiac rehabilitation referral, weight management, smoking cessation (already quit)
4. Aspirin therapy - continue
5. Consider beta-blocker therapy for rate control and symptom management
6. Close follow-up in 1 week after stress testing

Plan:
- Nuclear stress test scheduled for 08/27/2024 at 10:00 AM
- Follow-up appointment in 1 week (08/27/2024) to review stress test results
- Return to referring physician for ongoing primary care management
- Patient to call if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop

Patient and family educated about symptoms of unstable angina and when to seek immediate medical attention.
