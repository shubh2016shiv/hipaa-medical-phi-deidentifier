# HIPAA De-identification System Refactoring

This document outlines the key improvements made to the HIPAA de-identification system to make it more robust, maintainable, and effective.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Architecture Simplification
- Standardized on the `hipaa_deidentifier` implementation as the primary system
- Fixed API consistency issues between components
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing code

### 2. Entity Detection Improvements
- Enhanced pattern recognition for medical identifiers:
  - More robust MRN detection with contextual patterns
  - Improved encounter ID recognition
  - Better age detection for HIPAA compliance (ages over 89)
- Fixed entity merging logic to properly handle overlapping PHI entities
  - Now preserves entity text for proper redaction
  - Properly handles different PHI categories that overlap
  - Uses overlap percentage to make intelligent merge decisions

### 3. Security Enhancements
- Improved hash generation for PHI:
  - Increased minimum hash length for better security
  - Added validation of input parameters
  - Added warnings for insecure default salt usage

### 4. Robustness Improvements
- Enhanced date shifting to support more formats:
  - Added support for 15+ date formats
  - Improved handling of dates with time components
  - Added fallback pattern matching for non-standard dates
- Added input validation throughout the system
- Improved error handling to avoid silent failures

## How to Use

The system maintains the same API as before, but with improved functionality:

```python
from hipaa_deidentifier.deidentifier import HIPAADeidentifier

# Initialize the de-identifier
deidentifier = HIPAADeidentifier(
    config_path="config/hipaa_config.yaml",  # Path to configuration
    spacy_model="en_core_web_md",            # spaCy model for NER
    hf_model="obi/deid_bert_i2b2",           # Hugging Face model (optional)
    device=-1                                # -1 for CPU, 0+ for GPU
)

# De-identify text
text = "Patient: John Smith, DOB: 01/15/1980"
result = deidentifier.deidentify(text)

# Access the de-identified text
print(result["text"])  # "Patient: PATIENT_a1b2, DOB: 02/14/1980"

# Access detected entities
print(result["entities"])  # List of detected entities with positions and confidence
```

### Command Line Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
python deidentify.py --input patient_notes.txt --output deidentified_output.json

# With custom configuration
python deidentify.py --config my_config.yaml --input patient_notes.txt
```

## Testing

A new test script has been added to verify the system works correctly:

```bash
# Run the test with sample patient data
python test_with_sample.py
```

This will process the sample patient data in `data/patient_details.txt` and output the results to `test_output.json`.

## Configuration

The system uses the same configuration format as before. The main configuration file is `config/hipaa_config.yaml`, which controls:

- Which detection methods to enable (rule-based, ML-based)
- Which PHI categories to detect
- How to transform each category (redact, hash, pseudonymize, etc.)
- Format templates for transformed values

## Environment Variables

- `HIPAA_SALT`: Salt value for hashing identifiers
- `HIPAA_DATE_SHIFT_DAYS`: Number of days to shift dates
